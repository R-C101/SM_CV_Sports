That's his second of the night, assisted by the maestro Leon Draisaitl. The Oilers' lethal connection strikes again, putting the Flames on the ropes. This is the Oilers' legacy on full display, their offensive brilliance tearing apart the famed Calgary defense. With just over two minutes left, the Flames find themselves in a perilous position. The Oilers are one step closer to silencing the Scotiabank Saddledome and taking a crucial lead in this gripping playoff series.\n"
